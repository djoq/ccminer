A part of the recent algos were originally wrote by [djm34](https://github.com/djm34).

This variant was tested and built with VStudio 2013 on Windows 7 and Windows 8.1

Note that the x86 releases are generally faster than x64 ones on Windows.

About source code dependencies
------------------------------

This project requires some libraries to be built :

- OpenSSL (prebuilt for win)

- Curl (prebuilt for win)

- pthreads (prebuilt for win)

This fork now contains these libraries for both x86 and x64 platforms (windows).
